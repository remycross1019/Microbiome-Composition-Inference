# Code for Creating and Executing a Neural Network to Infer Microbiome Composition at Specific Threshold Values

### Process for Microbiome Inference
  1. Creating the Loss Function (LossFunctionMethods.py)
  2. Filtering the Data (Thresholds.py)
  3. Creating the Network Architecture (Architectures.py)
  4. Training and Scoring the Network (Network.py)


### Python Requirements
* numpy
* pandas
* skbio
* sklearn


### Scripts
#### 1. LossFunctionMethods.py

#### 2. Thresholds.py

#### 3. Architectures.py

#### 4. Network.py
